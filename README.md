# Chemically Reacting Flow Library

**CRFlowLib** is a collection of computational libraries with routines to simulate chemically reacting flows employing In Situ Adaptive Tabulation (ISAT) algorithm for thermochemistry calculation.

## I - Software History

**CRFlowLib** is the result of a master's thesis:

*A. Cunha Jr, Reduction of Complexity in Combustion Thermochemistry, PUC-Rio, Master Thesis, 2010* https://doi.org/10.17771/PUCRio.acad.17685
 
Available for free at: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01541173

The results of this thesis were disclosed in the following publication:

*A. Cunha Jr and L. F. Figueira da Silva, Assessment of a transient homogeneous reactor through in situ adaptive tabulation, Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, vol. 36, pp. 377-391, 2014.* http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40430-013-0080-4

If you use this code in any academic work, please cite the above references.

## II - Availability

The current stable version of **CRFlowLib** is available at GitHub:
https://github.com/americocunhajr/crflowlib


## III - Documentation

**CRFlowLib** routines are commented in order to explain their functionality to the final user. Each routine has a short description about its purpose, and a list of inputs and/or outputs.


## IV - Compilation
-----------------

**CRFlowLib** uses a Makefile for compilation. 

To compile all the modules type: make

To compile a specific program type: make program-title.exe
(e.g make pmsr-isat.exe)

See the Makefile for further details.


## V - Program Execution
----------------------

All programs depend on the ‘chem.bin’ file generated by ‘chem.exe’ program.

To obtain the ‘chem.bin’ file type: make run_chem

To run a specific program type: make run_program-title 
(e.g make run_pmsr-isat, make run_pmsr-di etc)

See the Makefile for further details.
