  Thermochemistry Mechanisms in Chemkin-II format
  organized by Americo Cunha Jr (2020)
---------------------------------------------------

This repository stores a collection of thermochemistry mechanisms in Chemkin-II format, for simulating chemically reactive flows. These kinetic mechanisms were developed by several research groups.

All of these mechanisms were made available, at some time, on the Internet or in specialized literature. This collection is the result of more than 15 years of searching. 

The repository owner makes them available here with the intention that they may be useful for researchers interested in the topic. 

Unfortunately, no guarantee can be given regarding the integrity of the files or the accuracy of the mechanisms. Use it at your own risk!
